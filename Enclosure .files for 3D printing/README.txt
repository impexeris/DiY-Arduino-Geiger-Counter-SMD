There are .stl files of enclosure variants for use with different Geiger-Müller tubes.
The original ones Top-For-SBM-20-Tube.stl and Enclosure5bottom.stl are for use with SBM-20 (СБМ-20) tubes.
Other variants contain the name of the tube they are for (namely STS-5, SI29BG, SBT9 and SBT11/SBT11A). Two files (top and bottom) are needed but you can also print the plug_for_serial.stl . It is a plug for the SerialTTl connection openning if you have cut it open and need to have it plugged.



Suggested print settings for PLA:

0.4  	mm print-head
0.25 	mm resolution
100%  	in-fill ratio
2    	shells
50mm/s 	default printing speed (may depend on your PLA)
50℃  	heated bed
215℃	     print-head temperature (may depend on your PLA)
100%      fan speed
25%       support in-fill ratio

(for SBT-11 enclosure)
35%  	Support in-fill ratio
Line      Support type
0mm       Gap between the support and top layer
5         loops of brim at 0mm from the print
Touch Platfor Only - support


     	printing volume enclosed

no raft and no brim if you have a good adhesion (this way top panel prints smooth and requires no post processing. 

! However if you a struggling with adhesion - use all counter means possible as this is the prolonged part with sharp straight corners and especially if you have to print on cold bed without Buildtak surface and no printer volume enclosure you will most certainly have a curl at the corners.
