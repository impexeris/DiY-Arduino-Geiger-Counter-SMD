Suggested print settings for PLA:

0.4  	mm print-head
0.25 	mm resolution
20%  	in-fill ratio
2    	shells
50mm/s 	default printing speed (may depend on your PLA)
50℃  	heated bed
215℃	print-head temperature (may depend on your PLA)
100%    fan speed
25%  	Support in-fill ratio

     	printing volume enclosed

no raft and no brim if you have a good adhesion (this way top panel prints smooth and requires no post processing. 

! However if you a struggling with adhesion - use all counter means possible as this is the prolonged part with sharp straight corners and especially if you have to print on cold bed without Buildtak surface and no printer volume enclosure you will most certainly have a curl at the corners.
