There are .stl files of enclosure variants for use with different Geiger-Müller tubes.
The original ones Enclosure5top.stl and Enclosure5bottom.stl are for use with SBM-20 (СБМ-20) tubes
Other variants contain the name of the tube they are for. Two files (top and bottom) are needed but you can also print the plug_for_serial.stl . It is a plug for the SerialTTl connection openning.



Suggested print settings for PLA:

0.4  	mm print-head
0.25 	mm resolution
25%  	in-fill ratio
2    	shells
50mm/s 	default printing speed (may depend on your PLA)
50℃  	heated bed
215℃	print-head temperature (may depend on your PLA)
100%    fan speed
25%  	Support in-fill ratio

     	printing volume enclosed

no raft and no brim if you have a good adhesion (this way top panel prints smooth and requires no post processing. 

! However if you a struggling with adhesion - use all counter means possible as this is the prolonged part with sharp straight corners and especially if you have to print on cold bed without Buildtak surface and no printer volume enclosure you will most certainly have a curl at the corners.
