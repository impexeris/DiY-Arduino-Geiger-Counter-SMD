Components are marked on the top or bottom side of the PCB - depending on which side they are placed.

Blue dots denote cathode side of diodes and the first pin of ICs.

Red cross on the top side shows where the trace has to be cut. It is important to cut the trace so that the potentiometer would work. 

This trace is reserved for the case when there is no wish to install the potentiometer so the backlight brightness is at maximum at all times.

For the case when the fixed brightness (but lower than maximum) is desired potentiometer can be replaced with fixed 0805 size resistor. This resistor can be installed on dedicated pats (on the left of the potentiometer pads)

When installing the electromagnetic buzzer G1 - check at the bottom of the buzzer where its + and - pins are (marking on the plastic casing sometimes does not match the markings on the bottom) and install in appropriate orientation.
